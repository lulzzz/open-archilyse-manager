# Portfolio Manager
The Archilyse Portfolio Manager allows you to work with the Archilyse API in a more intuitive way. As it is open-sourced under an MIT licence, you are free to do whatever you wish with it.

Getting started with our open-source portfolio manager is relatively straightforward. However, there are a few steps you need to complete before you can start using it.

## Getting Started

1. Create a free Archilyse account
2. Create a free Firebase account
3. Create a user with Archilyse API Key
4. Clone the GitHub repo
5. Add your credentials and serve the app

You can find a tutorial on getting things set up [here](https://medium.com/archilyse/getting-started-with-archilyses-open-source-portfolio-manager-cc773fd25901).

_This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5. You may need to download the Angular CLI to serve the app locally._

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
